## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```
### Docker Commands 

```
1) BUILD IMAGE : docker build -t developerfolio:latest .
2) RUN IMAGE: docker run -p 3000:3000 developerfolio:latest
```


## How To Use üîß

From your command line, clone and run developerFolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/BharatKammakatla/Developer-Portfolio.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd developerFolio

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

#Start's development server
$ npm start
```
## Github Setup For Open Source Projects

Generate a Github personal access token using these [Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) `Make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token`

1. Create a file called .env in the root directory of your project.

```bash
- DeveloperFolio
  - node_modules
  - public
  - src
  - .env         <-- create it here
  - .gitignore
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
```

2. Inside the .env file, add key `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` and assign your github token like this.

```javascript
 // .env

  REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN HERE"

};
```

Set `showGithubProfile` to true or false to show Contact Profile using Github, defaults to false.

Note: Projects section only show pinned items of your Github. If you are seeing [this](https://i.imgur.com/Hj6mu1K.png), please follow this
[Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/pinning-items-to-your-profile).

## Change and customize every section according to your need.

#### Personalize page content in `/src/portfolio.js` & modify it as per your need.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */

For example: To change greeting section just update the below block with your details:

const greeting = {
  /* Your Summary And Greeting Section */
  title: "Hi all I'm Bharat",
  subTitle: emoji("Software Developer üöÄ | Test Automation Engineer ‚öôÔ∏è | Data Science Enthusiast üéì"),
  resumeLink: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ofFdKF_mqscH8WvXkSObnVvC9kK7Ldlu/view?usp=sharing"
};

const socialMediaLinks = {
  /* Your Social Media Link */
  github: "https://github.com/bharatkammakatla",
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharatkammakatla/",
  gmail: "bharatkammakatla@gmail.com"
};

Similarly, you can also update all other sections.

const skillsSection = { .... }

const techStack = { .... }

const workExperience = { .... } 

const openSource = { .... } 

const bigProjects = { .... }

const achievementSection = { .... }

const blogSection = { .... }

const contactInfo = { .... }

const twitterDetails = { ... }

```

#### Using Emojis

For adding emoji üòÉ into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.


## Deployment üì¶ 
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.

#### Deploying to Github Pages

This section guides you to deploy your portfolio on Github pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name instead of `https://bharatkammakatla/` in `homepage` variable. For example, if you want your site to be `https://<your-username>.github.io/developerFolio`, add the same to the homepage section of `package.json`. 

- In short you can also add `/devloperFolio` to `package.json` as both are exactly same. Upon doing so, you tell `create-react-app` to add the path assets accordingly. 

- Optionally, configure the domain. You can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.

- Follow through the guide to setup GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).

#### Deploying to Netlify

You could also host directly with Netlify by linking your own repository.

For more information, read [hosting on Netlify](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#netlify).
